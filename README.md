# TensorFlow.js Spec

This project is a test suite against the TensorFlow.js. It encapsulates my learnings how TensorFlow.js works in a handy reproducible test suite. It also contains some example machine learning code.

## Running this project

Run `npm install` before running any of the commands below. Also I assume `budo` is on the path as I wrote most of this on airplanes without wifi. `npm install budo -g`. Also, these examples were written with the idea that the console would be open for messages.

### Tests

The tests run in the browser.

* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* Visit the webpage, the tests run in the console

### Examples

* `cd examples/name-of-example`
* `npm start` (make sure `budo` is installed globally)
